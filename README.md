Plant Disease Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) The Plant Disease Detection project leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately identify and classify plant diseases from images of plant leaves. By harnessing deep learning techniques, this project aims to provide farmers and agricultural stakeholders with an automated and reliable tool for early detection and diagnosis of plant diseases, thereby enabling timely intervention and effective management strategies.
